Before running the install script, define your sinks by creating sinks.json in the same directory

Example sinks.json:
[
	{
		"name": "sink1-with-no-output",
		"description": "This sink has no outputs"
	},
	{
		"name": "sink2",
		"description": "Sink 2",
		"output-sink": "bluetooth-headphones"
	},
	{
		"name": "sink3",
		"description": "Sink 3",
		"output-sink": "bluetooth-headphones"
	}
]
